How is your day going?\nEnglish- why are you learning English? What do you do every single day to achieve your desired English level? \nWork- what kind of work do you do? what is your favorite job up till now?\nMovies/series-Which series is your favorite? Explain to me the premise of that movie? which character do you relate to the most?\nHobbies- your current passion project?\nNews- I usually read the newspaper of that country to discuss any important event that may have happened that day.\nAnimals-Do you like animals? Which animal do you like to keep as a pet?\nI welcome questions as well. So you can ask me any questions and improve your listening during the process. \n Material: if a student is interested I send some article, video essay, etc and we discuss that during the lesson\nImportant: please check that you have the required internet speed to have a video or audio call.

I've taught host courses and undertaken host activities. So I can help you learn more professional Mandarin pronunciation. \n2️⃣In terms of teaching, I have taught oral English  for two years for college students, one year for tutoring classes for junior high school students and one year for children, etc. \nWith teaching experience of various ages, I've also accumulated many teaching methods, which I will integrate into the class to help you better learn Chinese.\n I enjoy talking and tutoring foreign friends to learn",
        "teaching_style": "The atmosphere of my class is pleasant and relaxed, because relaxed mentality is more conducive to language acquisition. \nThere is an old Chinese saying, 因材施教\"Teach students according to their aptitude\". I will adopt different teaching methods for students of different levels. After class, I may also send you different review materials according to students of different levels. For example, classes for young children will include interesting flash cards and games, and review videos will be sent after class for children to read the correct sounds. Classes for adults will include cultural allusion and knowledge that will enable students to become more relevant to Chinese society.",

Language learning is not only about language learning, but also about getting to know the world and yourself. What do you often do in your spare time? Which kind of TV shows you like best? What kind of vocabularies you are interested in? Let's discuss together!\n\n♥Life is a constant process of learning, I know I don't know everything, but this does not affect my enthusiasm for the world just like you learn Chinese. but remember not to get lost in memorising ‘rules’ and set structures. The more Chinese you read and listen to, and the more you practice, the more natural these structures will become. That's always the best way to learn.\n\nthe generation of characters indicates that people's thoughts, feelings, and wills can be accumulated into spiritual wealth.

          "description": "For beginners, progress is rapid and feedback is clear. But when you learn linguistics to a certain extent, you reach a bottleneck, You don't know what to do except keep your sense of language\nIt's a choice. You can give up because of some reasons even it's really a pity\nOne of my students used to believe that she can only communicate in heart by native language, not by Chinese. So she gave it up for a long time.\n♥But when she came to me, she was surprised to find that we had both read the same kind of tv , and she has the basic of Chinese. So we've opened a new door \n♥you can start to focus on expanding your Chinese vocabulary in your favorite areas♥\n\n♥I have previously assisted students systematically learn Chinese history, and I guided them through reading a book every week. They said that the busier the work, the more they need to stick to their heart. They expressed their gratitude to me, and I sincerely hope that in the future you can participate in Chinese reading parties, book signings, concerts, hiking parties and so on fluently in Chinese, find your like-minded friends, and make your life happier.\n\nBut in the beginning, you may not be able to communicate about advanced topics in Chinese fluently, such as talking about your feelings about a book or a movie. That's where my class comes in——it offers an opportunity to help you make that transition. In our class, we need to communicate in Chinese, such as talking about the reading of a book, talking about the feelings of a certain film and television work, or exchanging some interesting methods.\nWhile using your own language may allow you to communicate with someone's mind, it is when you use their language that you can truly reach their heart. I hope I can be a good friend to accompany you to see the world希望我可以成为陪你看世界的好朋友",

I can also help you with your writing of course. I also correct CVs, essays and personal statements. A typical IELTS lesson depends on where your weaknesses are. Some students want to focus on the Cue card and discussion questions and some want writing correction as well. I provide 24 hour access to my Dropbox folder which has lists  of the questions and also mp3 audio files of the answers to the questions. They are my answers and they should be able to help you make your answers longer if they are not long enough and help you learn some common expressions/idioms. Although the IELTS test is a test based on formal English, the speaking part is not. You really do receive a higher score if you can speak using these expressions occasionally.",

        "introduction": "I am a professional English teacher with a certificate in English teaching (CELTA) from Cambridge University ESOL. I have been teaching online for six years.\n\nI help my students improve their language skills: speaking, writing, listening and reading, with an emphasis on communication. Moreover, I teach language awareness, focusing on grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. I also teach exam preparation classes, for example, IELTS, CAE, and FCE.\n\nI have a passion for languages, so in addition to English, I speak French and Arabic fluently, and I'm learning German. In other words, I fully understand the challenges of learning a foreign language.\n\nI started my career as an electrical engineer, but I also have certificates and several years of professional experience in sales, marketing, logistics and customer service, so I also teach Business and Professional English.\n\nI occasionally teach Standard and Egyptian Arabic, and I taught French to absolute beginners several times, but I prefer teaching English.\n\nI particularly enjoy reading philosophical fiction, but I also love learning about history, culture and art. I am also a cinephile and I occasionally write film reviews, though I rarely publish them to my blog. Moreover, I love discussing sports and lifestyles, so if you are after conversation practice, we will never run out of discussion topics and activities.\n\nPlease visit my Linkedin profile for more information about me:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/amagad",

You will notice how Arabic will be incorporated in your life after the first lesson as I make flashcards and homeworks so that you don't forget what you learn in the lesson.\nThe most important thing for me is to know the student's purpose of learning Arabic to prepare the lessons well according to the student's interest.",

I am also patient and understanding, particularly when it comes to the struggles of learning a second language. My experiences with language learning give me insight into the challenges (but also rewards) you will meet in learning English.\n\nWhether you want to prepare for the IELTS, speak more with classmates or neighbours, understand the Irish accent, or improve your academic English, I can help. The most motivating thing for me as a teacher is the pleasure of helping someone to realise their potential and their own personal goal. Share your goals with me and let's see how we can get you there! 😊",

If I can make you laugh it not only makes classes fun, it has also been proven to help you hold and recall new information. In my classes, the goal is for you to speak confidently. Actively speaking the language is the best way for you to get comfortable, improve vocabulary retention, and measure progress. My teaching style is therefore fun, interactive, engaging and practical.",

Whatever you prefer! If you have a specific goal, test, business requirement etc., please let me know before the class. I can tailor my classes to your needs and learning style. I'm so looking forward to helping you on your English language journey!"

          "description": "These classes are aimed at children from ages 5-50. Yes, parents are welcome (even preferred) to attend the class along with the student, particularly younger students. In this class we will cover conversational topics ranging from our favourite foods or animals, to what we did that day, to our hobbies and aspirations for the future. If your child has a particular interest (e.g. space exploration, fashion, dancing, nature and animals) we can focus on these areas. The class will focus on correcting and improving conversational english, including pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary (and writing where needed). For younger students, we will play games and other fun activities. For those with a more advanced level of English, we can use these conversations to identify and target areas for improvement, and potentially choose other types of lessons which might benefit the student. I can tailor the classes to your needs and interests, and for those extra enthusiastic students, I offer homework and lesson plans! :)",

Because these building blocks are broken down into compact, digestible parts, it is possible to build a tailor-made curriculum to suit your needs and goals, as well as to take only one lesson at a time and propose a grammar point that has been causing you particular difficulty.

To tailor the conversation to your needs, you can choose the topic/s, and I will provide the feedback on your English directly during the class. If you prefer to cover a wide variety of different topics (this is advisable at the intermediate level, in order to expand your vocabulary), I can provide a diverse range of different topics as well as discussion formats. At the end of the class we will identify some grammar, vocabulary or pronunciation points to work on. If you send me the topic in advance I will send some useful grammar structures, vocabulary and expressions for you to practice in advance or follow up on during the class.",
