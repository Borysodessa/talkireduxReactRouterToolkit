      "about_teacher": "All I care about is:\n- Wellbeing \n- Efficiency\n- Confidence\n- Motivation. \nIt will always be my mission. If your motivation is high, then you can learn. I will fully adapt to you. I will not force you to do something that you genuinely don't want to do like homework or writing tasks. I'm very patient and enthusiastic about my job and I'm a very curious person so I love to know about my student's hobbies and try to articulate lessons around them. I try to keep a relaxed atmosphere in class and I will always do my best to make you feel safe. I'm also very flexible with schedules and methods so feel free to ask me if you need anything related to that!",
      "teaching_style": "My preferred method is through active learning. It's the most run-of-the-hill thing to say as a teacher but it's proven its efficacy countless times. I will make you guess things, teach you methodology to remember better and you will have exercises. A good teacher doesn't talk and explain non stop. They assist you, give you materials to learn from and guide through them. \nI'm very comfortable with any websites or technologies to learn, whether it be through games, videos, documents, mindmaps, texts, presentations, etc. I can always use what you prefer.\nAgain, your motivation is what matters most so if you want a more traditional approach, that's totally fine too!",

Think of it as a bit of an ice-breaker, wherein we can set goals, routines and parameters. \n\n Not every student will want to learn to read and write, some students may be after a crash-course prior to an upcoming trip. While others may desire to get in touch with their heritage; choosing to emerse themselves in the beautiful poetic culture of Urdu, or the religious serenity of classical Arabic.\n\nUltimately we can build a syllabus that works around you and your needs.\n So, why not book a trial today? \nStart¬†your¬†journey.",

        "description": "Globalization requires that you have the right skill set to engage with the international business community. I have experience teaching Business English to professionals from multinational companies such as Microsoft, BMW, Mastercard, Gucci, TikTok, Huawei, Unilever and Shell Oil Company. \n\nI teach both employers and employees on how to become effective communicators in the workplace. In my classes will cover topics such as:\n\n- how to develop and express your ideas clearly and confidently\n- business meetings (how to chair and participate in meetings)\n- presentations (how to deliver an unforgettable presentation)\n- negotiations (how to achieve a win-win solution)\n- business storytelling\n- customer service (dealing with customer complaints and queries)\n- how to build effective business relationships\n- writing formal emails\n- informal vs formal language\n- business terminology\n- idiomatic expressions\n- asking good business questions\n\nI started my own company 5 years ago, so I am familiar with the language they use in business. On iTalki, I am working with professionals in the engineering, medical, digital marketing, advertising, HR,  IT, banking, and automobile industry. \n\nThrough practical activities and customized lessons, you will be equipped with the relevant vocabulary, idioms, and functional language to effectively communicate in your unique business setting. Expect to speak confidently and clearly after these lessons. All your progress will be measurable. \n\nThe phrasal verbs that you will learn in the lessons will set you apart in any conversation. Pronunciation will also be emphasized during these lessons. As part of their continual learning, I also send short podcasts that my students can listen to. This will further increase their vocabulary and improve their fluency.",

They are now able to study abroad. \n\nRelax! You don't need to know every word in the dictionary to reach your required band score! Getting a band score of 7 or above could literally change your life forever! To get a band score of 7 or above, you will need to use the English language creatively as well as using complex grammatical structures and advanced vocabulary. \nHaving helped many IELTS students, I understand the pressure and struggles that IELTS students go through to reach their required band scores. I mainly help students who want to move from band 6 to band 7. These are predominantly students who are struggling to achieve a band 7 score either because of the speaking or writing part. The IELTS test is life-changing in many ways and I would love to help you achieve your dreams. These customized lessons will help you reach your required band score.  \n\nI will be able to identify the areas where you are struggling and create an effective plan to correct those mistakes. I will be offering you some tips and strategies to make sure that you are ready to ace your test! You will feel empowered to face the test head-on. The student will also be able to put more attention on their areas of weakness while also improving their areas of strength. \n\nAll your progress will be measurable.

You will learn how to answer:\n- \"Tell me about yourself\"\n- Competency questions\n- Describe your education and experience\n- Behavioral questions\n- Soft skills questions\n- General interview questions \n\nA successful interview requires you to tell a unique story about your skills, achievements, qualifications, and personality.

A successful job interview is one where you are able to differentiate yourself from other candidates. \n\nThis requires preparation, fluency, and confidence. You will be prepared to answer both common and unexpected questions in the interview. You will learn about the power words, verbs, and phrases that you need to use in your interview. You will be able to apply time-tested strategies to help effectively answer every question that is posed to you. You will learn to speak in a way that sounds \"clean\" and \"clear\".

Don‚Äôt talk about something obscure and difficult for children to accept. Therefore, I chose the textbook \"Easy to Learn Chinese\". There are children‚Äôs version and older version, which are suitable for different Children at this stage are learning Chinese. The textbooks are complete, and the textbooks are rich and colorful. With my patient and kind explanations, children will definitely fall in love with Chinese classes!\nAt the same time, for Chinese children, we can read picture books, idiom story books, ancient poems, etc., according to the children's Chinese learning level and needs, to help children better understand Chinese culture, so that they can plant Chinese in their young hearts The seeds of learning help them thrive and grow into towering trees of cross-cultural communication!",

      "teaching_style": "In my lesson,  firstly I assess each student on their language ability and then formulate a plan of action in the most effective way of teaching that student. I used alot of different teaching methods, from a slow pace teaching approach to grammar lesson that teaches the student how to use grammar effectively in each language. \n\nFor beginners, we will start with the basics together.  Firstly working on basic sentences and pronunciation. From the 1st lesson, I will teach you some basic sentences and words so you will be speaking before you know it.\n\nI am a very laid back and patient teacher, I am great with beginners and children.",

      "about_teacher": "For me, teaching is not just a side job, but a passion and a career. I invest 100% in my students and even dedicate time to do research on the most effective ways to learn English. I had academic training when it comes to teaching as well as a lot of in-class and online experience. I like to consider myself a very friendly and encouraging teacher and am glad to say that my students say the same about me. As a teacher, creating a positive, fun experience for my students is an essential part of the job. I like to make my students forget that they are studying but rather enjoy the process while they are unconsciously acquiring the language just like a native speaker.",
      "teaching_style": "The teaching style that I adopt with you will depend on your goals and level, as well as your preferences. I acknowledge that every student is different and that the \"One size fits all\" approach does not work for everyone. If you are looking to improve your speaking skills for example, then we will work on topics of your interest, and talk freely about them. To make this easier for you, based on our first introductory session, I will make a list of potential topics that you might find interesting and we can go from there. I will also provide you with material to read or watch before class preferably so you can expand your vocabulary even more. That is just one example of how a lesson can go.",

We do all of this in context, focussing on the grammar mistakes that you make most often and looking at new vocabulary that you will actually use! Conversation based calls/classes are great if :\n\nÔºä  You want to improve your Chinese conversation skills, for work or anything else.\nÔºä  Your Chinese is at a high level and you just want to find out how you can make it better.\nÔºä  You're getting ready to work or live in a Chinese speaking place.\nÔºä  You've been studying Chinese for a while but you're not sure how to improve or what you should study next!\n\nThese classes work best when we agree a topic or subject before class that you would like to discuss. This way I can bring materials and resources to class that can help you get the most out of our time. If you don't have anything in particular that you would like to discuss then I am happy to suggest a topic for us. \n\nAt the end of our call I will always send you the notes that I have made, including any corrections, recommendations, or new vocabulary. üìù\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send me a message!",

I have a very active teaching style, but I also believe that a good teacher should employ various teaching styles for optimum learning outcomes. My style incorporates my personality as I enjoy portraying a wide range of emotions and total physical response (TPR.) I put a lot of focus into speech, facial expressions, and body language, and it's a lot of fun! I encourage self-discovery and student interaction as I hope to build confidence within my students.",

I'm here on italki to help you to improve your Spanish skills. I know how challenging it can be to learn a language. I myself am studying Japanese, and German.The language learning journey never ends as there is always something new to learn. The most important thing, however, is that you have fun along the way. By doing so you will have an improved memory. For example, when we learn new words, we can link them to certain sounds in our native language and create a ridiculous and entertaining story. The crazier the story, the more likely it will stick in our memory. I learned that from \"Fluent in 3 months\" by Benny Lewis. Our lessons will adapt to your specific needs: conversation, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. //HOLA SOY OSCAR, de Per√∫, pa√≠s en el que se habla un espa√±ol neutral. Ya sea que tengas en mente tomar el DELE, profundizar la Gram√°tica, ampliar tu vocabulario o simplemente practicar tus habilidades comunicativas-pongamos esos m√∫sculos de la boca a trabajar, jaja-. Trato de hacer mis clases divertidas y amenas, he tenido la oportunidad de conocer personas de todo el mundo-Jap√≥n, Rusia, China, etc. Es una experiencia realmente enriquecedora. Adoro ense√±ar. , WE CAN RECORD IT SO YOU CAN WATCH LATER!, ISN'T THAT GREAT? LET¬¥S HAVE FUN LEARNING SPANISH!!!!!!

One rule governs innumerable emotions. The rules under which these rules of language are studied together are called grammar.\nLanguage may vary from person to person. Thus, the form of a language is not definite. Due to ignorance or confusion, some people make mistakes in the pronunciation or meaning of words. Thus the form of language is distorted. The function of grammar is to maintain the correctness and uniformity of the language.\nIn fact grammar compiles and analyzes language rules and fixes these rules. These grammar rules standardize and define the language. Grammar itself does not make rules of language. Grammatical rules determine grammatical rules using the form of language that people of a linguistic society use. Therefore, it can be said that - Grammar is the scripture in which the rules for the knowledge of the pure form of a language are stated.\n\nYou will learn the following points under Hindi Grammar syllabus.\na) Etymology (‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞) \nb) Phonology (‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£-‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞) \nc) Syntax (‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞) \nd) Noun (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ) \ne) Pronoun (‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ) \nf) Verb (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ) \ng) Tense (‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤)\nh) Adjective (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑‡§£) \ni) Indeclinable (‡§Ö‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø) \nj) Gender (‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó) \nk) Prefixes (‡§â‡§™‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó) \n\nHindi grammar is a broad subject.

Eu gosto muito de idiomas e sempre tento aprender um pouco da culturas de pa√≠ses diferentes lendo ou conversando com pessoas. Eu sou formado em tecn√≥logo de recursos humanos mas pretendo mas para frente me aperfei√ßoar no ensino de l√≠nguas. Hoje estudo ingl√™s e franc√™s. Ingl√™s j√° a um tempo ent√£o o considero intermedi√°rio e o franc√™s ainda estou no come√ßo.

      "about_teacher": "My experience with languages goes way beyond the internet, I have never been a licensed teacher, but I always enjoy helping friends and relatives when I am familiar with the linguistic subject. I taught a few classes for English friends and family and always enjoy passing along what I have learned. The best knowledge for me is that which is shared and not kept. I studied English for a year and a half and now I'm trying Spanish. I am also in the last year of philosophy. Education has always been important to me.",
      "teaching_style": "In my tutorials I like to talk about various topics that can be chosen by me or the student themselves. They can be recent topics, such as news, or about Brazilian history or Brazilian curiosities. I try to provide my students with lighter moments where we can talk in a relaxed manner, with only minor corrections, in order to provide a fluid and stress free environment for us both to feel comfortable in. For optimal enjoyment, students will enjoy my classes if their Portuguese is around level B1-B2 to enjoy an immersive language experience, if the student is below A1-A2, don't worry! I have other solutions so that the conversation doesn't get too difficult, even if that involves using some E",

I am a patient listener and strive to create a comfortable learning environment where my students can feel at ease and push themselves out of their comfort zones to improve their language abilities. With fluency in three languages - English, Hindi, and Nepali - I understand the challenges that come with learning a new language, and I am here to guide you through the process. Whether you need assistance with reading, writing, speaking, or conversation practice, I am confident that I can help you succeed.",
      "teaching_style": "I specialize in conversation-based language lessons. From my experience, I've found that chatting is the most efficient way to pick up a new language. During our lessons, we'll cover a variety of topics that will help you actively expand your vocabulary. In addition, I'm always interested in getting to know my students better and building friendships, so we'll take the time to ask each other questions and get to know each other.\n\nI like to make our lessons fun and engaging, and I believe that a relaxed and enjoyable environment is the best way to promote effective learning. So if you're ready to take your language skills to the next level, let's schedule a lesson and have some fun! Thank you",

They are part of sentences, paragraphs, whole conversations, and when we combine sounds together, they change, and you will learn exactly how that process works in Korean.\n\n‚òÖThe Art of Pronunciation is designed to help you to be a better communicator. The core of language is conversation, and good pronunciation makes conversation easier, so good pronunciation equals good communication.\n\nThe course has three main objectives:\n\n‚òÖThe first objective is to destroy myths and misconceptions, and explain what is possible, and necessary, to do with your pronunciation to communicate effectively.\n‚òÖThe second objective is to show you the most important sounds in Korean and how to produce them, including:\n‚ÜíA complete guide to Korean consonants\n‚ÜíA complete guide to Korean vowels\n‚ÜíHow to combine sounds in connected speech\n‚ÜíThe prosody of Korean, including rhythm, stress and reduction\n‚ÜíHow to practice and measure your pronunciation and much more!\n\n‚òÖAnd the final, and biggest, objective of this course is to kill shame. \n\n‚óÜResearch shows that pronunciation is probably the number one cause of shame and embarrassment for people learning a language. That is not acceptable, and by the end of this course you will love the way you speak.\n\nCourse length: 20 lessons \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nLevel 1(Basic) : My Korean 1 & 2 (60 lessons)\n‚û°How to read Hangul / Korean alphabet / Writing system\n‚û°Basic expressions for use in everyday conversations.\n‚û°Writing short sentences.\n‚û°Pronunciation : Diction / Correction and practice.\n‚û°Grammar : Hangul syllables / Subject particles / Simple tenses / Interrogative\nI will be available to help you with your learning until you're able to speak with confidence and fluency.",

      "introduction": "Hallo everyone,\n\nSince my first trip abroad, I have been fascinated with language structure and acquisition. Although it was not immediately in the forefront of my mind, I was always scanning and analyzing differences in languages ever since. So, after I had finished my studies in business law, I decided to take a position at the stock exchange of Stuttgart. There, as a member of the legal department, I was co-responsible for international relations. My main activities included the negotiation and drafting of legal agreements, whereby we had to overcome great linguistic and cultural barriers at some times. We managed to navigate those tricky waters with a lot of linguistic and cultural research. After I had been working for over a year in that field, I started to feel a great desire to take a break and travel around the world. I have never regretted that decision and continue to live my life the way I feel it should be lived. Over the years I have traveled to many countries and collected valuable insights and techniques about language acquisition, which I would like to share with you. I am a strong supporter of the immersion theory, which provides the great prospect of learning a new language very fast and efficient while immersing the student in the target language. Therefore, I always try to hold my classes in the language you want to learn, and that from the get-go.\n\nFeel free to join me in our journey of learning a new language every day, all days!\n\n***My cancellation and absence policy***\nPlease let me know asap if you can not attend our lesson.

In my travels around the world, I have learned to quickly comprehend other points of view, which is very helpful when meeting my students and teaching them German. Before teaching German full-time to students all around the world, I was a professional business lawyer. Working for the stock exchange of Stuttgart has been my longest endeavor in this field and there I have learned how to overcome language barriers in international communications. Since then I have developed strongly my communication and teaching skills and am very happy about being able to effectively teach my students German.",
      "about_teacher": "You can expect an attentive teacher, who will carefully listen to you and provide you with helpful feedback and advice. All this feedback and new concepts/words/expressions learned I will write down for you in a Google Doc. I am always genuinely interested in my student's topics and therefore I know that we will find a common ground on which we can conduct our productive lessons. In general, I am a teacher who can talk about anything and use every moment as an example for teaching purposes. Last but not least you can expect a teacher with a high command of the German language and an ample repertoire of speech expressions.\n\ncontact me for more: valerius82@gmail.com or Skype (same email)",
      "teaching_style": "My lessons focus primarily on the ability to speak and secondarily on grammar in order to reinforce the learning process. There will always be a determined effort on my side to create a relaxing environment in our lessons. With that and my ongoing support, I am sure that you will be speaking abundantly from the first lesson on. \n\nSince repetition and the knowledge of basic structures are very important for quickly learning a language, I make it a habit to use the same words and language structures repetitively in my lessons after introducing them to my students.   \nAt the beginning of the lesson, we will probably talk about your day in order to warm up and practice some small talk.",

The Media-Lesson is for more advanced Students to practice their skill and learn more. The Conversation Lesson is for Talking, as expected. \nSince i started teaching on Italki i am writing my own \"Teaching\"-Book. Have a look inside to get an overview of what awaits you. Also this File is the Structure of my Grammar Lessons. \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1f46N53LUhWG2DVvmXynjQUcnTWlwZHnrIoe76KiJhLo/edit\n\nMy Skype does not like me anymore, but i can offer a Discord Server.

      "about_teacher": "I have been teaching Korean for more than 4 years to adult learners of various nationalities, both online and offline. I have also taught Korean to multicultural families residing in Korea at a cultural center. As an experienced language teacher and learner myself, I believe that learning a language goes beyond grasping concepts and involves cultural understandings in diverse aspects. Korean, with its numerous conjugations and high-context nature, requires frequent exposure in various contexts for comprehensive understanding. Working on it by yourself can be challenging, but my lessons are designed to make this process easier and more enjoyable for my students!",

        "description": "ü§Ø üìö Simply studying a lot of Korean grammar and memorizing vocabulary lists doesn't guarantee that you can use Korean naturally. This is because many Korean words and grammatical expressions are used differently depending on the context, carrying distinct nuances. Moreover, In reality, many \bthings that are either not found in textbooks or differ from them are also frequently used. \n\nüîë ‚ú® The key to fluency in the Korean language lies in the application and practice of its concepts across a variety of real-world situations and contexts, guided correctly. It involves creating sentences that \"you are likely to use in your life\" and \"vocalizing & writing\" them until they become deeply internalized, and practicing paraphrasing these sentences in various ways is necessary. \n\nüßôüèªüî• For this journey, I have created customized resources for this class, offering plenty of practice opportunities and guidance to suit your level in a comfortable atmosphere. If you are an absolute beginner, we'll start by forming basic sentences with essential grammar points. Otherwise, we'll start by learning the areas in which you need improvement, gradually constructing sentences that sound native. Above all, I've designed this course to be both fun and effective for everyone!\n\n----\n\n*If you're looking for lessons that \buse textbooks from university Korean language institute, these are also available. I would recommend them for those planning to work or study in Korea and who can commit to regular sessions, at least twice a week.",

While spontaneous conversation is a key component of language learning, it's not enough on its own.

It's designed to be flexible, and could change to suit specific situations and needs.\n\nüìå Prior to each lesson, you will receive a specific topic to prepare at home in advance of our meeting.\n\nThe one-to-one lesson is structured in three parts:\n\nüü¢ The first part is devoted to spontaneous conversation, fostering your confidence to express yourself spontaneously.\n\nüü¢ The second part revolves around discussing the pre-assigned topic. By responding to tailored questions provided in the document, you can organize your thoughts and structure your speech. You're encouraged to create an outline and write down few notes to refer to during the lesson, aiding in more effective expression of your ideas.\n\nüü¢ The third part comprises two alternating activities. \nThe first activity involves describing an image or a virtual tour, which encourages attention to detail and raises awareness of areas in need of improvement regarding vocabulary and expressive fluency.\nThe second activity involves reading a text, such as a book excerpt or article, allowing us to focus on correct pronunciation and delve into the cultural context presented in the text.\n\nüîé Grammar is integrated into the lesson plan and is included in the materials provided for each session. Following preparation, we will review, correct, and enhance grammar usage as needed. Grammar exercises will also be included in homework assignments.\n\n‚úèÔ∏è  After our session, you will receive a written review summarizing the keywords raised, grammatical points to focus on, and any errors needing attention.\n\nIf you're new to Italian studies, I will equip you with the necessary tools to start speaking from day one. Materials provided will be always tailored to your proficiency level.\n\nIf you believe this method suits your learning style, feel free to contact me today. I'll be happy to guide your steps on the way of your Italian learning journey.",

I also have a TEFL Certificate from Oxford Seminars. I have extensive experience teaching English in formal and informal settings as well as online, most recently with a large Chinese company. Jobs I have had range from Assistant to the Superintendent of The American School of Puebla, to Head of the Arts Department at Varee International School in Thailand to Professor of Art and Director of International Affairs for the Faculty of Art and Architecture at Rajamangala University in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I am also a painter and my interests are wide ranging which make me an interesting conversation partner. I love to get to know my students, their passions and their life goals. I tailor my extensive teaching experience to each student so as to help him or her reach their language goals as quickly as possible and in the funnest way. I am happy to work with all levels of students, though my favorite type, at this moment in my life, is fellow, young career professionals making their way in the world.",

I enjoy online teaching although I am interested in working abroad as a TEFL teacher and gaining more classroom experience. The opportunity to spend time in a foreign country to learn about a new\nculture and possibly a new language is appealing to me. I think culture forms an important part of language learning and I enjoy discussing these areas with students.",
      "teaching_style": "My teaching style is quite relaxed and I do not necessarily plan lessons unless a student wants to work on something specific. The emphasis is mostly on speaking practice and for students to express themselves on a wide variety of topics. In doing so, they should learn more about the English language and hopefully the Anglophone world. I also enjoy looking at the written work of students and enjoy these lessons when they crop up. Sometimes I use resources such as audio recordings and online articles to keep lessons stimulating or if a student so wishes . I send corrections and language tips via the chat on each platform and can point students in the direction of further resources.",

Since this is a trial lesson, let us first get to know each other. After that, we will proceed to a formal lesson. I will focus on observing and helping you correct your grammatical mistakes, including sentence structure and pronunciation. After the lesson, I will provide an evaluation and tips to help guide you in developing your fluency in English, Tagalog, or Cebuano-Bisaya. Our lesson will be fun, easy, and engaging. See you soon, and I am happy to help you!\n\nTake note: I am offering a more affordable lesson package for you. If you want to become fluent, it is better to take five or more lessons. Just check out my available schedules and feel free to book a lesson now."

Awesome! üí≤üí∞\n\nI'll work with you hand-in-hand to maximize opportunities by optimizing your CV/resume, tailoring your cover letters, and perfecting your interview skills üëç\n\nBecause I've been a hiring manager in several Fortune 500 companies I am the perfect coach to accompany you along your journey to get your new Dream Job. I know 1st hand what the interviewers are looking for and expecting from you. Best of all, I know exactly how to coach you to be the best you can be, shining a light on all of your most valuable strengths. I'll share with you my guaranteed interview strategy to maximize your winning that job. üí™üí™\n\nWe will select all of the most relevant questions to practice.\n\nThese classes are perfect if you are just starting your plans to change jobs, as well as preparing for the unexpected interview tomorrow.\n\nCourse Progress Journey:\n \nOur journey begins with reviewing your Job Description (JD). I then help to review and optimize your English CV for maximum impact on both human readers as well as machine (AI) readers. From here we work together to draft a flexible cover letter template suitable to use with other JDs. \n\nOnce this work is in good shape, we will begin to draft answers to many typical, standard interview questions, along with some questions that are specific to the company where you will be interviewed. Example standard questions include a self-introduction, why should we hire you, what are your strengths, and many more.\n\nThen, in following classes, we will practice the answers in a realistic mock-interview style, and I will continue to help review and optimize the answers to create maximum value to the interviewer. As we finalize answers to each question we will continue to add new Q&A to the growing list of questions, practicing and revising, until you are fully confident and prepared, or until the interview date has arrived and our journey comes to an end. üòä",

In the video above I speak quite quickly so don't worry if you didn't understand everything, that's why I'm here! From my own experience learning French and Spanish I can say that conversation is the best way to both reinforce everything you are learning and to find the places where you need to improve. It is also an opportunity to get away from the books and remind yourself that what you're learning is a real functioning language spoken by real functioning people ;) I'm able to adapt to a teaching style that suits you. We will talk about this in the first lesson and I will do my best to accommodate any requests you may have. Feel free to send me a message if you already know what you prefer. We will begin simply with conversation but there will be the opportunity to use any resources that you may want to bring to the lesson ‚Äì songs, news articles or anything else easily accessible online or that you can send me before/during the lesson. I've recently bought a book called \"Grammaire Anglaise\", a book about English grammar written for French students of English. I will be studying this gradually and using it as a reference to enable me to offer better insights and more helpful explanations about the way the English language works. I have studied astrophysics at university level and have an understanding of a more academic use of English.. I also play the guitar. I'm more than happy to use the guitar as a focal point for lessons if you're also a guitarist ‚Äì we can discuss our favourite musicians and steal each other's ideas ! *** IMPORTANT *** For the 5 lesson package: all 5 lessons must be taken within 3 weeks of me accepting the request :)",
      "about_me": "The lessons are offered with maximum adaptablity to each student's individual requirements and goals. Lessons can be teacher- or student-led and can cover any subject of personal interest or professional demand.",
      "about_teacher": "My approach is to offer students a comfortable environment in which they can make all the mistakes necessary to gain a high level of English. Mistakes are an inevitable part of learning a language so the important thing is to not be embarassed!",
      "teaching_style": "Conversation lessons will provide the opportunity for students to practice what they know and receive advice on their weak and strong points. Various types of structured lessons will also be available. The details of these may change over time so make sure to keep an eye out for what is available!",

If you are not sure, write to me and I will send you a quick and easy online test that will help us evaluate it. \n\n‚úçüèΩ ‚Ä¢ I hope to see you in class and explore the Spanish-speaking world together!",

I came to Germany eight years ago to study mechanical engineering at a university, and I have been working near Berlin for the past 4 years. Having studied Germany intensively for 4 years, I know the difficulties of learning the German language and would like to help others master this language. In addition to German, I enjoy teaching my native language Turkish. If you would like to learn German or Turkish, you can contact me.\n\n‚Ä¢ A PROVEN WAY for QUICK RESULTS\n\nFor me it is very important that your German improves quickly.\nIf you have suggestions on ways to optimize our lessons them simply let me know.\n\n‚Ä¢ STEP BY STEP FOR BEGINNERS\n\nIn order to make your German familiarity better, I will teach you the grammar fundamentals. \nBefore our lesson begins, I'll send you useful learning material. That way, you have a chance to prepare and get the most out of our lessons and learn quickly. After you have a better understanding of the topic I'll assign you homework, so that you can see your progress for yourself. \nTo get the most out of our sessions, I recommend that you pick up this book: Deutsch als Fremdsprache ISBN 978-3-922989-70-7 (9,60 Euro)\n\n‚Ä¢ FOR ADVANCED LEARNERS:\n\nAt this level I will continue to help you with your grammar. Here we will also work on your reading and listening skills by working through many exercises together. In order to keep the lesson fun we'll be working with interesting topic that we pick before hand. In only a short amount of time you'll really start to notice your progress.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you soon!!\n\nich freue mich schon darauf, von Dir zu h√∂ren",

        "description": "**This lesson is for intermediate & advanced (B1 - C2) students.**  Are you interested in Japanese history....such as samurai, castle, shoguns? I love Japanese history, especially the Sengoku period, the age of fighting throughout the country during the 15 & 16 centuries. I like reading and watching movies & documentaries about Japan's history as well as the world history. If you are interested in these topics, let's discuss in Japanese! I'd be happy to hear the history of your country, too. I can only speak/understand little English and my lessons will be conducted in all Japanese. Looking forward to talking to you! * *  For lessons,  Zoom is available only for 30 mins lessons. For longer lessons, please choose Skype or italki Classroom.

Therefore, Vocabulary, Grammar, and Pronunciation are, in my humble opinion, the three main pillars of a good and productive English conversation class.",
      "teaching_style": "Since I only teach adults, one-on-one, (18+) Pre-Intermediate to Advanced levels I feel free to choose the tools used in our classes.\nI email articles and video clips ahead of time so they can go over and prepare the material accordingly. They recount the video clips' general ideas using their own words.\n The texts are read out loud so I can follow and answer any question about vocabulary or grammar. The pronunciation will be corrected at all times.\nThe video clips as well as the articles generate CONVERSATION, which is the sole purpose of the classes. \nAs a result, we cover conversation, grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Goals that are set out and achieved in each class.",

And that is the essence of my Conversation classes: CONVERSATION as the main subject but always emphasizing Vocabulary, Grammar and Pronunciation.\n\nThe 30-minute lessons are available to those students who are interested in Conversation only. In that case, I'll send a video prior to our next meeting. When getting together again it will be a straight discussion about the topic of said video, and, of course, some other topics that might arise naturally.",

Hence, classes will now start from 7:00 PM 'til midnight, PHT, 'til further notice. If my new schedule proves to be difficult, especially for those who bought a package, please contact me as soon as possible so we work out our schedules. Thank you for understanding.***\nI have a Bachelor's Degree on Communication Arts, Major in Mass Communication. I worked in the customer service industry for almost 13 years, talking to native speakers of English on a daily basis. I have experience with recruitment, training and front line management. I shifted to online teaching March of 2016.\nI can teach students on all levels. I teach Business English, Conversation English, Grammar, Pronunciation and Accent Neutralization.\nI tailor my teaching to my student's learning style and learning curve. That means, if you want me to go slow, I can. If you want me to go fast, I can do that too. Should you just want to have a conversation, that's super 'cause I enjoy that the most! Having a conversation is the easiest way to learn new things. So I can't wait to learn from all of you!\nYour first call with me is when I will assess your skill. Yet what's more important to me is to know what you want to learn. So never hesitate to tell me what you want to get out of my classes. I'm more than happy to listen.\nI will come up with a lesson plan for you. The lesson pan will not only be based on what you need to improve on. It will also be about the things you're interested in. This way, you will surely enjoy every class.\nAfter each class, I give detailed yet concise feedback. I'll let you know what your strengths are, what you need to improve on and what we can do to work on them. I can also give you some activities you can do on your own so you can continuously learn even without a teacher.\nSo thank you for checking out my profile. I look forward to speaking with you. Stay awesome!",

I absolutely adore learning languages and I love to help others learn them too, and I can't wait to help you in your journey of English.

I can help you gain confidence, and adapt the level of the language that is being spoken to a level in which you feel comfortable.",

Regarding oral expression and vocabulary, the courses are adapted to his needs, his daily life and / or world news. The work program depends on the skills of the learner. Indeed, in order to determine its real level, I assess it beforehand from preliminary target exercises (written and oral) and discussions. Finally, I adapt his program to his daily life to allow him to be familiar with the lesson. My teaching method thus respects a well-defined and modern training program.",

      "introduction": "Hello there! My Name is Vicky. I was raised in a French and English environment and I've taught to children and adults in the past as a teacher in a private school. My experience with languages goes back to college/university where I learned Spanish, German and Italian. The way I teach is by having discussions and adding some grammar if needed. I mainly focus on speaking practice since I think this is the best way to become fluent. I have many different ways of teaching and I talk about it with my students first to see what they like best. During my time in my languages program in college, I learned the business language also. My program consisted of communication classes along with languages which helped me develop my business skills. I am now a tutor online as well, where I teach beginners of any age. I like teaching children as much as adults. What I can do for you: - Conversation practice - Pronunciation coaching - Accent coaching - Grammar lessons and more *As your tutor, you can reach me 24/7 for help outside of classes.

      "about_me": "Hello there! My name is Vicky Frost and I am passionate about languages. My goal is to learn as many languages as possible. I was raised bilingual by my French mother and English father. My level of French and English are therefore equal. My experience with other languages goes back to college where I learned Spanish, German and Italian while having literature classes in English and French. Later, I studied teaching for second language learners at University. I'm quite outgoing and love to share my passion for languages. I also like traveling, video games, singing, and playing piano.",
      "about_teacher": "I now have 6 years of experience teaching online and 2 years of teaching in schools. I teach to both adults and children (at least 10 years old). I mainly focus on speaking practice on Italki since I think this is the best way to become fluent. I usually use recast as a corrective method but I will adjust my interventions according to each student's needs. I also have many different ways of teaching and I talk about it with my students first to see what they like best.  \n\nWhat I can do for you:\n\n- Conversation practice\n\n- Pronunciation coaching\n\n- Feedback\n\n- Corrections",
      "teaching_style": "Lessons are different for every student since I customize my classes for everyone. I now teach only conversation with students while correcting their mistakes out loud. I also type some notes on skype/zoom while talking and explaining when needed to make sure that nothing is missed. For conversation classes, I usually engage in discussions with a topic chosen by the student for the vocabulary to be more relevant to them after having several classes. That way we won't talk about the same thing all the time. I then make all corrections verbally while having a conversation. The goal is to have an immersion.",

Fear of speaking, lack of confidence and fear of making grammar mistakes can all be overcome with the help of a calm and patient teacher and I strive to be that teacher. In this class I will guide you through your speech in a structured way, never stop you mid-sentence, take notes of the point to focus on and teach you the necessary points to speak fluently. It is a conversation based course but all skills will be covered. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Hope to see you soon.",

(I usually have another lesson right before yours and thus don't have the availability to start earlier.)\nDon't start asking additional questions when I am about to close the lesson. Answering those takes time from my break time and might also prevent me from being on time for the next lesson. Instead, type your questions in the chat box and I will make sure to answer them as soon as possible.\n\nLESSON LENGTH: \nThe usual lesson length is of 59 minutes, BUT, in case I have back-to-back lessons, I will offer you only 55 minutes OR I will ask you to start and finish the lesson 5-15 MINUTES EARLIER so that you can benefit from the full 59 minutes.\nPACKAGE PRIVILEGES\nPackages are offered ONLY on demand and ONLY to committed students who have taken more than 10 classes with me.\n\nRESCHEDULING or CANCELLING less than 24 hours before the lesson is scheduled to start is NOT possible and/or negotiable.\nI will not accept students' requests to reschedule or be refunded for classes they intend to miss or have missed.",

I have been studying English for over 10 years now and therefore I know how it is to learn a new language. I recently moved to Canterbury in the United Kingdom to go to University. I am very interested in learning languages and meeting people from other cultures. If you would like to learn German, you can book an informal class with me. You can also get a discounted trial lesson if you are new to iTalki. I can also help you if you own any books to learn German and would like to get some help with the exercises. Apart from German I can also offer you to practice your English. Before I started University I also had to do the IELTS English Examination which means that I can also help you if you have any questions about this test. If you are going to take the IELTS it is important to practice speaking English in order to get a good grade. Hallo mein Name ist Daniel und ich bin hier um euch Deutsch bei zu bringen. Ich bin 22 Jahre alt und komme aus Deutschland. Ich lerne englisch mittlerweile seit √ºber 10 Jahren und wei√ü wie es ist eine neue Sprache zu lernen. Vor kurzem bin ich nach Canterbury in England gezogen um hier in der Universit√§t zu studieren. Ich bin sehr an sprachen interessiert und lerne auch gerne √ºber anderen Kulturen. Wenn du daran interessiert bist Deutsch zu lernen, w√ºrde ich mich freuen, wenn du einen Unterricht mit mir Buchst. Neben der deutschen Sprache kann ich dir auch mit Englisch helfen. Bevor ich nach England gezogen bin musste ich die IELTS Englisch Pr√ºfung bestehen und kann dir Fragen √ºber diese Pr√ºfung beantworten. Solltest du den IELTS nehmen ist es wichtig die Aussprache zu √ºben und ich w√ºrde mich freuen dir dabei zu helfen.",

      "introduction": "I am a successful language learner who taught himself English later in life (23 when I started out). I am of humble birth so work was always a priority and I never really had so much time or enough money to get my head down for hours to learn languages like polygosts or other successful language learners do. I have never been to any English speaking country either. I am just an average person like you\n\n*My classes last 55 minutes as I need to get ready for a lesson right after yours*\n\nHOW IT WORKS?\nYou will receive tailor-made support with enough flexibility to ensure that you get the best from your programme of study.\n\n1) First, as a prospective student you will be interviewed for 30 minutes (trial lesson) to assess the following: - your current level of proficiency as well as the level of proficiency you wish to reach - the kind of Spanish you wish to focus on - the way you best tackle a foreign language (e.g. whether you are an auditory or visual learner).\n\n2) From this interview, I come up with a recommendation in line with your needs. The purpose of this is to: make sure you have a clear understanding of what you are learning and aiming for - allow me to monitor whether you are advancing toward your previously agreed objectives.\n\n3) You will be introduced to my online resources. I will provide you with the material necessary for class and self-study through Google Drive and email.\n\n4) Lastly, once you have devised a programme to suit your needs, and provided that you can give total commitment to it, I guarantee that you will achieve your learning language goals. \n\nCANCELLATION POLICY\n*You can be up to 15 minutes late for class. More than 15 minutes, the lesson will not take place.\n*Scheduled lessons can be cancelled with at least 24 hours' notice. If you cancel a lesson with less than 24 hours' notice, I reserve the right to claim the ITCs. \n*It is up to the student to have the lesson with the camera on or off, and to ask for the same in return. Comfort counts.",

Nevertheless, unless they're SUCCESSFUL language learners themselves, they won't be able to guide you through the techniques for/processes of effectively acquiring English or any other language. In a nutshell, at best they might be able to tell you 'what's wrong', but they might not be able to 'fix it'. \n\nOver the course of my lessons, I  will walk you through all manner of language learning TRICKS as well as the main implications of Second Language Acquisition (based on my own experience) whilst exploring the English language by your side. \n\nI look forward to meeting you soon! \n\nSee you in our lessons.",

I'm originally from London, UK, but I am currently based in Barcelona where I teach English to both children and adults. I have experience giving classes to people of all ages - from 5 to 70 years old! I am able to adapt my methodology, vocabulary, and speed to the requirements and abilities of my students. If your aim is to refine your conversation skills in English, then let's have a class together and I will provide discussion topics to expand your vocabulary AND your confidence!\nIf you don't see a time that suits you on my calendar, message me and I'll try my best to adapt to your schedule :)",
      "teaching_style": "The main objective of all my classes is to empower my students to feel confident in speaking English. No matter what their level is, I want my students to feel confident in speaking the language to the best of their ability. I achieve this goal by ensuring my classes are always engaging and using vocabulary and grammar relevant to the needs of my student. From the first class, I will ask you what your language goals are so I can curate a lesson-by-lesson plan to achieve them with you. For example, if you are moving to an English-speaking country, I will ensure you are equipped to handle all day-to-day scenarios - from doctor's appointments to haircuts!",

In 2008 and 2009 I taught at an English camp for French speaking children in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.  My favorite thing about being a teacher is seeing my students succeeding and reaching the potential I see in them.  I love customizing my teaching approach and techniques to best fit each student as I learn more about teaching from every one.",

I am glad to go over articles, news, documents, or videos if that will best serve you.  I will not give homework most of the time.\nI will correct your mistakes with kindness and gentleness.  If you do not wish to be corrected, I am not a good teacher for you.",

You don't have to worry about awkward silences, because he guides the class with thoughtful questions that allow the students to think deeply about their answers, which is good for strengthening the skill of  thinking in English. Ken is also a great typer, which allows him send any mistakes that occur directly to the student to ensure the student understands the mistake and how to fix it. Pronunciation is one of his strong points and has various strategies that has worked very well with his prior students. Despite all that, Ken maintains a very laid back and calm demeanor throughout his classes.",
      "teaching_style": "For every lesson, in-class typed out corrections are always provided. Free talk with corrections is the most common lesson Ken teaches. This tests student's ability to speak freely on common daily topics to improve the student's conversational speed. Online conversation topics is another type of lesson Ken provides. These lessons encourage the student to speak on deeper topics which strengthens the student's ability to describe complex ideas, use uncommon vocabulary, and think critically. One more would be daily news articles which are good for introducing new vocabulary, checking pronunciation, discussing the student's views and opinions. Ken is also open to any class the student suggests",

They learn easier if we focus on their interests, and so I incorporate these into their lessons. My lessons include drawing, crafts, reading, telling stories, lots and lots of games, interactive worksheets, pictures, flashcards, toys, and show-and-tell.  The aim is to get the child to speak and listen while having a fun time. Children have so much fun that they do not realize they are learning.‚≠ê Book a lesson today!‚≠ê",
